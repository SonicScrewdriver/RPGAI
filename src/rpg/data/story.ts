  explanation: `Welcome, Troubleshooters, to another day in the Alpha Complex! Our reliable vending machines are behaving erratically, dispensing items without taking credits and sometimes even the wrong items. The Computer suspects sabotage from a secret society. Your mission is to investigate this anomaly, identify the cause, and restore order. Ensure the vending machines return to their normal operation and root out any traitors responsible for this disruption. The Alpha Complex, a sprawling and futuristic labyrinth, is a testament to The Computer's benevolent rule. Here, citizens live under constant surveillance, their every action monitored for signs of treason. Paranoia is a constant companion, but remember, it's all for your happiness! Good luck, Troubleshooters. The future of the Alpha Complex depends on you!`,
